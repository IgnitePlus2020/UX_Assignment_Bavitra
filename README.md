This is a prototype E-commerce furniture website. Added a feature called CUSTOMIZE.
The customize option helps new shoppers who are still unsure of what exactly they are looking for.
The new shopper is asked to choose a few photos from the choices they are presented with.
From the selected pictures an approximate calculation is made and the customer is presented with a 
set of options that might be closest to their style and is presented under the "Get the look"
component.
